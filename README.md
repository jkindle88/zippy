zippy

Thanks for downloading Zippy!  This program is designed with  a very 
simple and specific use in mind.  When run, it will package everything
in the folder of your choice into a nice 25mb-or-less zip file.  This will
allow you to send music or large documents over email!

For the power user, there are a bunch of ways to send files that aren't
terribly straightforward for someone who rarely uses the computer.  This
attempts to simplify the process.

===================================================
Running Zippy
===================================================

1.  First, create a folder somewhere on your computer and note the file path.
For example: C:\Users\Jim\Documents\zippy_files

2.  Then, put all of the files you wish to send in this folder.  They can be any
format, but folders will be excluded.  
  NOTE: Make sure each file is smaller than 25mb.  Files that are too large will need
	to be skipped, as the resulting zip file would be too large to email.

3.  Run (double-click) Zippy.exe.  

4.  Remember that file path from step one?  You will need it now.  Enter it into
the prompt and let Zippy do the rest!

5.  In your folder, a new folder called "zips" will be created.  
	NOTE: More than one zip file may be created, so you may need to send
	multiple emails.  One zip file to each email.
